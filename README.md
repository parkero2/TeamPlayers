# TeamPlayers
Team Players is a plugin designed for Spigot-based servers.

The mod automatically switches players' teams when another team kills them. The last team/largest team standing wins.

For each player you intend to play on the server, you need to assign them a color in the following format manually
`ChatColor.Red`
